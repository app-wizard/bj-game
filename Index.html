      <h2>How to play</h2>
      <p>
        Blackjack, a classic card game, revolves around achieving a hand value
        as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Played with standard
        decks of 52 cards, each card holds its own value: number cards (2-10)
        are worth their face value, face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) are
        valued at 10 points, and Aces can be counted as either 1 or 11,
        depending on the player's advantage. At the outset, players and the
        dealer are dealt two cards each. Players make decisions to "hit,"
        receiving additional cards to improve their hand's total, or "stand,"
        opting to keep their current hand. If a player's hand value surpasses
        21, they go "bust" and automatically lose the round. The dealer, on
        the other hand, must adhere to a set of predetermined rules, typically
        hitting until their hand value reaches 17 or higher. Victory hinges on
        having a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's without going bust.
        Achieving a two-card total of 21, known as a "Blackjack" (comprising
        an Ace and a 10-point card).
