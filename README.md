# BlackJack Game Project PP2 (HTML+CSS+JS)

The website's objective is to provide users with the opportunity to experiment with various strategies in the game of Blackjack, to acquaint them with the fundamental rules of the game, and to offer a space for relaxation and unwinding.

The website is divided into two main sections. 
- The first section contains information about the game rules, where users are prompted to select a nickname and initiate the game. This section also offers access to the outcomes of the most recent 10 gaming sessions. 
- The second section directly presents the playing field, segmented into distinct parts including the dealer's cards, the score display, the player's cards area, and the game control buttons section.

The entire visual design employs dark tones, incorporating thoughtfully chosen backgrounds that simulate the gaming environment.
